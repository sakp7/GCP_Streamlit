Problem Statement- 
A Housing Finance company deals in all home loans. They have a presence across all urban, semi-urban and rural areas. Customers first apply for a home loan after that company validates the customerâ€™s eligibility for a loan. The company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real-time) based on customer detail provided while filling out the online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, and others. To automate this process, they have given a problem identifying the customer segments, that are eligible for loan amounts so that they can specifically target these customers. 

Solution:
To answer the problem statement, we have built our Machine Learning Model using logistic regression and created an interface using StreamLit. Next deployed it to Google Cloud using Docker and Google Cloud Shell.  Below are the steps involved in completing the project:
Data preprocessing 
Creating our model
Building an Interface using StreaLit
Deploying our model into the Google Cloud Platform using Docker and Cloud Shell
